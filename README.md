Sample Project of OpenGL and for references 

Requirement to compile the source code:
1. Linux Operating System or mingw64 
2. GNU Make or GNU GCC or g++ compile
3. GLFW library
4. Glad - a library that helps in loading OpenGL function pointers at runtime, as these functions are not known at compile time
https://glad.dav1d.de/

Each examples has Makefile special text file that you can read how to compile the source code, for example: 

```c
gcc -Wall -g hello.c -o hello -lglfw -lGL
```
